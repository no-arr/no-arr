# 0array
Hello! I am **0array**. I work on web applications and games with Godot & Unity. I am a full-stack web developer who enjoys creating projects that appear simple and minimal to the viewer, often using flat dark colors. I am Pakistan, and I am currently 17 years old as of 2025. In the future, I aspire to be both a full-stack developer and a data scientist.

## My Projects
> "⏰" means the project is no longer in development by me.
### ⏰ Cubern
[Cubern](https://cubern.sbs) was an online sandbox where creativity knew no bounds. Here, you could develop games and could had customized your character to showcase your style and passion.
#### Behind the Scenes
For the workshop, I utilized Godot 4.2 (.NET) in previous versions with custom compiled export templates for resource protection. It predominantly (99%) employed C# with minimal GDScript. I had also integrated [AOT Compilation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/) featured in .NET 8.0.

I was utilizing later on Unity Game Engine.

For the runtime programming language (lua), I used [Moonsharp](https://www.moonsharp.org/) both on the client and the game server. And before leaving it I was shifting to [NLua](https://github.com/NLua/NLua) which is an interface between C# and C-Lua interpreter. 

On the website's backend, I leveraged ExpressJS as I explored JavaScript. For the frontend, I opted for VueJS due to its user-friendly nature and Single Page Application feature, ensuring a smooth experience for users.

### ⏰ Mopimo!
I also have made a port of a computer game [Bopimo!](https://bopimo.com) to Mobile and MacOS. It was written mostly with GDScript so the port was easier. However for GDExtension related part I did that work on a remote linux server which returned the result back to the port client or I would simply re-write the functionality missing in GDScript.

## Other Projects
### Kubeo!
[Kubeo](https://kubeo.net) is an online sandbox where users can build their own games with its editor. The project is very similar to cubern. I am using Godot 4.5 for it along with C# completely. It is a project very identical to Cubern! I also published a [blog](https://blog.kubeo.net/the-current-state-of-the-kubeo-workshop-and-the-scripting-api-2/)

### Fast Studios
[Fast Studios](https://www.faststudios.online/) is a game development studio which publishes games on roblox. I am currently working on Pokemon Tower Defense where I make use of LuaU and Roblox Studio.
